We develop theories and methods to understand complex systems and help people deal with an ever increasing complexity of the world around us.

We apply the theories and methods we develop to real and virtual systems to either confirm existing knowledge about those or provide completely new understanding of their inner relationships and evolutionary dynamics.

Our work usually results in computational models and interactive tools that are aimed at supporting human sense- and decision-making to create a new and meaningful form of machine augmented intelligence.
</p>

<h3>What are complex systems?</h3>

<p><i>Our world is full of systems where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts and where change is hard to impossible to be predicted.</i><br />

Social movements that break out on social media, a serendipitous scientific discovery that turns into a billion dollar innovation, the personality of a human individual over its lifetime, bacteria that become resistant against antibiotica; all these can be looked at as complex systems.</p>

<h3>What is connection science?</h3>

<p><i>The solution to complex problems is transdisciplinary.</i><br />

Connection science brings the computational sciences together with other disciplines such as psychology, neuroscience, philosophy, linguistics, sociology and cognitive science. This transdisciplinary approach seeks to leverage what's technically possible in a way that is inclusive and improves lifes.</p>

											<h3>Why equivalence and invariance are both different and essential for scientific studies of culture: A discussion of mapping processes and theoretical implicationsh</h3>
											<p>We contribute to recent discussions about the role of invariance testing in cultural, multi-group and longitudinal research by highlighting that these debates obscure two different questions. Most researchers are interested in the quality of a first mapping process of concepts onto numerals, that is the quality of measurement. Due to a lack of independent data, researchers typically resort to a second mapping, focusing on the differential item functioning of items relative to each other. This second mapping links items to proposed constructs and the question is about symmetry of observational patterns across measurement occasions. Importantly, additional theoretical assumptions are invoked during this process, which can be queried through invariance testing. Using multiple items to index a shared construct is quite a different question compared to what researchers typically want to know, namely, whether the measurement process itself is free of bias. We argue that invariance testing is a theory-testing process rather than a pure methodological tool. We use three examples to highlight that a) the two mapping processes are distinct and b) that paying attention to invariance as the second mapping process is of theoretical (and not just methodological) interest for researchers interested in culture, over and above a concern with the first mapping. We also briefly discuss a third mapping process, which has been suggested as an alternative to invariance testing. We highlight shortcomings of these recent recommendations. Our plea is that researchers pay more attention to invariance testing as a theory-guided process.</p>

											<h3>A computational approach to study the gap and barriers between science and policy</h3>
											<p>Research on the gap between science and policymaking and the barriers to utilizing science in policy remains controversial, since previous research methods have dominated data collection with perceived participant responses. This approach makes research findings applicable to particular contexts, particular participants, and particular times but cannot be generalized. We used a computational model to analyse linguistic text data from two communities and compared the results with self-reported research findings. The outcomes support that scientists and policymakers have their own linguistic characteristics, with scientists in the medical field preferring jargon and policymakers’ language containing public satisfaction pressures. Language representation also validates the existence of barriers in the use of science.</p>

											<h3>Assessing the Quality of Bibliographic Data Sources for Measuring International Research Collaboration</h3>
											<p>Measuring international research collaboration (IRC) is essential to various research assessment tasks but the effect of various measurement decisions, including which data sources to use, has not been thoroughly studied. To better understand the effect of data source choice on IRC measurement we design and implement a data quality assessment framework specifically for bibliographic data by reviewing and selecting available dimensions and designing appropriate computable metrics, and then validate the framework by applying it to four popular sources of bibliographic data: Microsoft Academic Graph, Web of Science, Dimensions, and the ACM Digital Library. Successful validation of the framework suggests it is consistent with the popular conceptual framework of information quality proposed by Wang and Strong (1996) and adequately identifies the differences in quality in the sources examined. Application of the framework reveals that Web of Science has the highest overall quality among the sets considered; and that the differences in quality can be explained primarily by how the data sources are organised. Our study comprises a methodological contribution that enables researchers to apply this IRC measurement tool in their studies; makes an empirical contribution by further characterising four popular sources of bibliographic data and their impact on IRC measurement.</p>

											<h3>Opportunities and Challenges of Extracting Values in Autobiographical Narratives</h3>
											<p>We report three studies in which we applied a value dictionary to narratives. Our objective was to test a theory-driven value dictionary for extracting valuable information from autobiographical and narrative texts. In Studies 1 (N = 106) and 2 (N = 152), participants wrote short autobiographical narratives and in Study 3 (N = 150), participants wrote narratives based on ambiguous stimuli. Participants in all three studies also completed the Portrait Value Questionnaire as a self-report measure of values. Overall, our results demonstrate that it is possible to extract value-relevant information from these narratives. Extracted values from autobiographical narratives showed average correlations of 0.07 (Study 1) and 0.12 (Study 2) with self-reports compared to an average correlation of 0.01 for the extracted values from implicit motive tasks (Study 3). The correlations with self-reports were in line with previous validation studies. The most salient values in narratives diverged somewhat, with a stronger emphasis on achievement values compared to self-reports, probably due to the nature of salient episodes within one's life that require demonstrating success according to social standards. Benevolence values were consistently most important in both self-ratings and text-based scoring. The value structure emerging from narratives diverged from the theoretically predicted structure, yet broad personally vs. socially focused value dimensions were qualitatively discernible. We highlight opportunities and challenges for future value research using autobiographical stories.</p>
